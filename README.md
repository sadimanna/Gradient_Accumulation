# Gradient_Accumulation

**Optimizer with Gradient Accumulation and Custom Learning Rate Scheduler**

This repository is an extension of the works in https://github.com/bojone/accum_optimizer_for_keras

Building on the works done in that repository and another file contributed via *Pull Request* which seems to be there unmerged since June 1st, 2020. So, instead of adding another *Pull Request* (which may not be accepted in my lifetime!) the author of these files decided to create another repo, so that the changes I made should not remain hidden from the rest of the Human Civilization.
